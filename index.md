Once upon a time, in a rainy Saturday evening, I was born in Kolkata, one of the metropolitan cities in India. My family named me ‘Tirna’, in Sanskrit which means ‘to succeed’. Anyway, without understanding the deeper meaning of the name, I started my journey. I grew up in the suburban area around Kolkata, in close connection with my family, the clear dark sky full of stars, the evergreen trees and physics and mathematics.

I was a good student since my childhood, which helped me to get admission to one of the premier institutes in India for science, Presidency university. In the cacophony of the city life, finally I found an abode of peace in astronomy. Thanks to the universe, for quenching the scientific and artistic desire of a tiny human-being like me. 

After a long way through Bachelors and Masters studies and research at the Presidency University in Kolkata, NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA in Pune, I arrived at the Kapteyn Institute in the Netherlands for pursuing PhD in astronomy. Through several ups and downs, I hope my PhD journey will ‘succeed’ and take me to another scientific adventure in a new place. 

If you want to know more about me and my research, please find the link to my CV here. If you want to share something, please feel free to contact me.
