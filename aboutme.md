### Welcome to My Digital Abode!

Once upon a time, I was born on a rainy Saturday evening in Kolkata, one of India‚Äôs vibrant metropolitan cities. My family named me ‚ÄòTirna‚Äô, meaning ‚Äúto succeed‚Äù in Sanskrit. Without fully realizing its meaning, I embarked on my journey, growing up in the suburban areas around Kolkata‚Äîsurrounded by my family, clear dark skies full of stars, evergreen trees, and a passion for physics and mathematics.

I pursued my education at Presidency University, India, where I found my calling in astronomy, a field that quenched both my scientific curiosity and artistic sensibilities. My journey took me across multiple institutions‚Äîfrom NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA in Pune to Kapteyn Institute, Netherlands, where I completed my PhD in Astronomy. After a successful PhD, I ventured into independent research in South Africa, and later, at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard University, funded by the prestigious Rubicon Fellowship.

### From Astronomy to Data Science & Quantitative Research

Throughout my research career, I worked extensively with large-scale astronomical datasets, advanced statistical modeling, and computational techniques‚Äîskills that seamlessly translate into data science, machine learning, and quantitative research. From analyzing terabytes of observational data to developing predictive models, I‚Äôve honed expertise in Python, R, SQL, statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, time series analysis, and AI-driven insights.

Currently, as the Principal Investigator of my research project, I independently design methodologies, work with high-dimensional data, and build analytical frameworks to answer complex questions. Beyond academia, I am eager to apply my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and programming expertise to data-driven industries, including finance, tech, and AI research.

### Beyond Science

After living across four continents, I consider myself a global citizen. Beyond equations and data, my heart beats for painting, singing, weaving short stories, crafting vlogs, and the rhythmic dance of poetry.
