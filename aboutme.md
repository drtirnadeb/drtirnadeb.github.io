Welcome to my digital abode! Once upon a time, I was born on a rainy Saturday evening in Kolkata, one of India's vibrant metropolitan cities. My family named me ‘Tirna’, in Sanskrit which means ‘to succeed’. Anyway, without understanding the deeper meaning of the name, I started my journey. I grew up in the suburban area around Kolkata, in close connection with my family, the clear dark sky full of stars, the evergreen trees and physics and mathematics.

I was a good student since my childhood, which helped me to get admission to one of the premier institutes in India for science, Presidency university. In the cacophony of the city life, finally I found an abode of peace in astronomy. Thanks to the universe, for quenching the scientific and artistic desire of a tiny human-being like me.

After a long way through Bachelors and Masters studies and research at the Presidency University in Kolkata, NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA in Pune, I arrived at the Kapteyn Institute in the Netherlands for pursuing PhD in Astronomy. Through several ups and downs, my PhD journey ‘succeed’ed and propelled me to another scientific adventure in South Africa.

I obtained an independent fellowship in South Africa to conduct postdoctoral research after my PhD. After working there for a year and half, 
I was awarded the prestigious "Rubicon Fellowship" by the Dutch Research Council to conduct independent research at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard University. Currently I am conducting research as the principal investigator (PI) of a project that I designed myself. I am working towards broadening my horizon in Astronomy and Data Science. 

After living in four different continents across the world and experiencing diverse geographical and cultural diversities, I consider myself a global citizen. Beyond the equations and data, my heart beats for painting, singing, weaving short stories, crafting vlogs, and the rhythmic dance of poetry.

For those curious about my journey and research, you can find my CV here. Feel free to drop me a line if you'd like to share something or connect.

Thank you for stepping into my digital world in which I am not so active yet. :) I look forward to weaving more chapters into my scientific and creative narrative.
