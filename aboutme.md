Once upon a time, in a rainy Saturday evening, I was born in Kolkata, one of the metropolitan cities in India. My family named me ‘Tirna’, in Sanskrit which means ‘to succeed’. Anyway, without understanding the deeper meaning of the name, I started my journey. I grew up in the suburban area around Kolkata, in close connection with my family, the clear dark sky full of stars, the evergreen trees and physics and mathematics.

I was a good student since my childhood, which helped me to get admission to one of the premier institutes in India for science, Presidency university. In the cacophony of the city life, finally I found an abode of peace in astronomy. Thanks to the universe, for quenching the scientific and artistic desire of a tiny human-being like me.

After a long way through Bachelors and Masters studies and research at the Presidency University in Kolkata, NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA in Pune, I arrived at the Kapteyn Institute in the Netherlands for pursuing PhD in astronomy. Through several ups and downs, my PhD journey ‘succeed’ed and took me to another scientific adventure in South Africa.

I obtained a prestigious fellowship in South Africa to conduct independent research after my PhD. Currently conducting research as the principal investigator (PI) of a project that I designed myself. Moreover, I am passionate about mentoring students, currently I am mentoring two master’s students for their thesis project in South Africa. I am also visiting several universities in the USA to broaden my collaboration and my scientific understanding.

After living in four different continents across the world and experiencing diverse geographical and cultural diversities, I am now open to broaden my horizon beyond astronomy.

If you want to know more about me and my research, please find the link to my CV here. If you want to share something, please feel free to contact me.
