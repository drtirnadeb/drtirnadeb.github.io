## SYMPHANY: A Cosmic Symphony of Galaxy Evolution

### The Cosmic Dance of Galaxies
Galaxies are dynamic, ever-changing entities, shaped by the delicate interplay of gas, stars, and cosmic forces. Some evolve in isolation, while others interact, collide, and transform within dense galaxy clusters. But what drives these changes? Why do some galaxies thrive while others lose their ability to form stars?

These questions fuel my research in SYMPHANY (SYnergy of Molecular PHase And Neutral hYdrogen in galaxies in A2626)â€”a project that orchestrates the role of gas in galaxy evolution. My goal is to unravel how atomic (HI) and molecular hydrogen (Hâ‚‚), the fundamental fuels for star formation, behave in different cosmic environments.

### Gas: The Hidden Architect of Galaxies
A galaxyâ€™s fate is tied to its gas supply. HI gas extends beyond galaxies, forming reservoirs for future star formation, while Hâ‚‚ is the dense fuel that directly births stars. Yet, in crowded environments, powerful forces like ram-pressure stripping (RPS) can strip away HI, quenching star formation. The mystery? Some stripped galaxies still form starsâ€”suggesting hidden processes at play.

To decode this puzzle, I am leading a multi-wavelength observational campaign focused on A2626, a galaxy cluster rich with dynamic substructures.

### A Multi-Telescope Quest
I am using some of the most powerful telescopes in the world to map the evolution of galaxies in A2626:

ðŸ”­ MeerKAT (South Africa): Imaging HI gas to understand how galaxies are pre-processed before entering the cluster.
ðŸ”­ ALMA (Chile) & SMA (Hawaii): Tracing molecular gas (Hâ‚‚) to explore how galaxies retain or lose their star-forming fuel.

By combining these datasets, SYMPHANY provides a panchromatic view of how galaxies transform across different environments.

### Unraveling Cosmic Mysteries
With this approach, I seek to answer:

What forces turn star-forming galaxies into gas-poor, quiescent systems?
How does a galaxyâ€™s environment shape its molecular gas supply and future evolution?

### A New Perspective on Galaxy Evolution
By harmonizing cutting-edge observations with compelling visual storytelling, SYMPHANY composes a cosmic symphony of galaxy transformation. Each dataset, like a musical note, contributes to a richer understanding of the grand orchestration that shapes our universe.

ðŸ”­âœ¨ The cosmos is a symphony, and I am here to listen. ðŸ˜Š
