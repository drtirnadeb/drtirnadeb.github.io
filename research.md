## Illuminating Galaxy Evolution:  SYMPHANY Project

## Unraveling the Cosmic Mysteries of Galaxy Evolution

The universe is a vast and dynamic space, teeming with galaxies of all shapes, sizes, and compositions. At the heart of galaxy evolution lies an intricate interplay between gas, stars, and cosmic forces that dictate their life cycles. Some galaxies thrive in solitude, while others collide, interact, and undergo dramatic transformations in dense clusters. But how do these environmental factors influence the fate of galaxies?

This is the central question driving my research in the SYMPHANY (SYnergy of Molecular PHase And Neutral hYdrogen in galaxies in A2626) projectâ€”a pioneering investigation into how galaxies evolve as they move through different cosmic environments. SYMPHANY orchestrates the understanding of the role of gasâ€”specifically atomic hydrogen (HI) and molecular hydrogen (Hâ‚‚)â€”in shaping galaxy evolution.  ðŸŽ¶âœ¨

## Gas: The Invisible Fuel of Galaxies

Galaxies are not just clusters of stars; they also contain vast reservoirs of interstellar gas, which serve as the essential raw material for star formation. The two key phases of hydrogen gasâ€”neutral atomic gas (HI) and dense molecular gas (Hâ‚‚)â€”are crucial indicators of a galaxyâ€™s ability to sustain star formation. While HI forms extended gas discs around galaxies, Hâ‚‚ resides deeper within, where it condenses into stars.

However, in crowded galactic environments like clusters, galaxies often lose their gas due to powerful external forces. Ram-pressure stripping (RPS)â€”a process where hot cluster gas sweeps away a galaxy's hydrogenâ€”is one of the key mechanisms that quench star formation. Yet, a puzzling contradiction remains: why do some galaxies stripped of their HI still retain their molecular gas and continue forming stars?

To address these mysteries, I am leading an ambitious multi-wavelength observational program, leveraging some of the most powerful telescopes in the world to study the transformation of galaxies in A2626â€”a moderately massive galaxy cluster surrounded by dynamic substructures.

## A Multi-Telescope, Multi-Wavelength Investigation

The SYMPHANY project harnesses the capabilities of cutting-edge telescopes to explore different components of interstellar gas across A2626 and its surroundings:

ðŸ”­ MeerKAT (South Africa) â€“ One of the world's most sensitive radio telescopes, providing high-resolution imaging of atomic gas (HI) in galaxies from the cluster core to its outskirts. I am currently analyzing fresh data to uncover how galaxies are pre-processed before entering the cluster.

ðŸ”­ ALMA (Chile) & SMA (Hawaii) â€“ These sub-millimeter telescopes trace molecular gas (Hâ‚‚), offering insights into how star-forming galaxies retain or lose their dense gas reservoirs under environmental pressures. With ALMA and SMA observations, I am investigating 50 galaxies with varying gas content and stripping signatures.

Together, these observations provide a panchromatic window into the different phases of gas and their role in galaxy transformation.

## Key Scientific Questions

Through this multi-faceted approach, SYMPHANY aims to answer fundamental astrophysical questions:

What processes dominate the transformation of galaxies from star-forming and gas-rich to quiescent and gas-poor?\
Why do some HI-stripped galaxies continue forming stars despite losing their atomic gas?\
How do different environmentsâ€”cluster cores, outskirts, and galaxy groupsâ€”affect molecular gas reservoirs?\
How do the gas properties of galaxies in A2626 compare with other well-studied clusters like Virgo and Fornax?
