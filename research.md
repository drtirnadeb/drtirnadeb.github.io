Motivation: The extended, fragile, collisional neutral hydrogen gas (HI) discs in galaxies are not only the fuel for star formation, but also serve as diagnostic tracers of gravitational and hydrodynamic processes in the cosmic environment they are residing in. The goal of my PhD is to investigate the key question “how do cluster galaxies evolve?" using state-of-the-art research instruments. On a smaller scale, I am studying multi-phase baryonic component in the ‘jellyfish galaxies’, the extreme examples of ram-pressure stripping with in situ star formation in the tail. On a larger scale, I am trying to understand how the local and global cosmic environment of galaxies in Abell 2626 galaxy cluster influence their morphologies and the star formation activity.
